                Originally this site was created as supplemental practice to The Odin Project's curriculum, and while it still serves this purpose I have come to the conclusion that there is no reason that I cannot use it for sharing various material. As such, this site is a bit of a catch-all for anything I wanted to share on the internet.

                The most common thing you will find on here are guides and bookmark collections for various games that I love. I have them shared them on Discord servers for friends that wanted to try them out, but since I have qualms with the direction of Discord, I thought I would also post them somewhere else so that they are still available in the event I stop using the software.

                Additionally, as many of you will be familiar with, there's always that one go-to family member for tech support. For my family that person is me, so I plan to make blog-style posts that I can re-use if someone else needs help with the same thing later on. Putting them online has the added benefit of making them available from anywhere, and for anyone to link their own family to. I hope that you find them useful, and informative.
