              If you are unfortunate enough to miss the opportunity to acquire one of the promotional cards during your play-through, there is another way to acquire them. After defeating the the Grand Masters at the Pokémon Dome, each time the game's save file is loaded, provided you are not in the Challenge Hall, there is a 25% chance that the Challenge Cup becomes available. The prize for winning the Challenge Cup is a random promo card.

            <p>
              <em>Note</em>: The Legendary cards (Moltres, Articuno, Zapdos, Dragonite), Phantom cards (Venusaur and Mew Lv15), and Imakuni? are not a part of the Challenge Cup Prize pool.
