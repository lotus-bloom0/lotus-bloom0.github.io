              <h4 id="ishihara">Ishihara's Trades</h4>
              <p>
                Ishihara is an NPC that offers three promo cards for trade. He is only found in the north-western building after you have spoken to one of three NPCs: the Woman in the Rock Club break room, the Lad in the Science Club break room, or the Chap in the Fire Club break room. After he appears you must save and reload your game, and speak with one of these NPCs again in order for him to offer his first trade. This save, reload, and speaking with the previously mentioned NPCs, must be repeated after each trade is completed. 
              </p>
              <h4 id="challenge-cup">The Challenge Cup</h4>
              <p>
                If you are unfortunate enough to miss the opportunity to acquire one of the promotional cards during your play-through, there is another way to acquire them. After defeating the the Grand Masters at the Pokémon Dome, each time the game's save file is loaded, provided you are not in the Challenge Hall, there is a 25% chance that the Challenge Cup becomes available. The prize for winning the Challenge Cup is a random promo card.
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>Note</em>: The Legendary cards (Moltres, Articuno, Zapdos, Dragonite), Phantom cards (Venusaur and Mew Lv15), and Imakuni? are not a part of the Challenge Cup Prize pool.
