# My Personal Website

A personal website to use as supplemental experience/practice for The Odin Project curriculum, and other various development books I own.

I use it to host various pages that I’ve made as tutorials or informational write-ups that I have made for my non-technical friends, and as a place to publicly share my video game bookmarks.
